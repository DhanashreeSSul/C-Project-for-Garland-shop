#Garland (Mala) Billing Program
This is a C++ program that allows users to select and order flower garlands of various types and sizes. Each type of garland has three sizesâ€”small, medium, and largeâ€”with predefined prices. At the end of the order, the program generates an invoice with the total cost, a 20% discount, and the final price after the discount.

Features
Selection of Garland Types: Users can choose from ten types of garlands, including Marigold, Champaka, Lotus, Lily, Ashoka, Oleander, Chrysanthemum, Rose, Hibiscus, and Mixed.

Sizes: Each garland type is available in three sizes:

Small (S) - 100 Rs per garland
Medium (M) - 200 Rs per garland
Large (L) - 400 Rs per garland
Order Quantities: Users can specify the quantity for each size, and the program calculates the total cost per size.

Invoice Generation: After the user completes the selection, an invoice is generated that includes:

Total cost per size
Overall total cost
20% discount on the total cost
Final price after the discount
